# CSC251-80-Homework-4-Pointers

This repository contains practice projects using pointers in C

## Composition
This repository contains the following programs:
1. closestFlight.c
2. validPalindrome.c
3. qsort.c

## Purpose
### 1. closestFlight.c
Determines the flight closest to a user's arrival time at the simulated airport

### 2. validPalindrome.c
Determines whether a string of letters (ignores punctuation and spaces) is a valid palindrome (ex: race car)

### 3. qsort.c
Implements the quick sort algorithm using pointers

## How to run on unix
The following example will be used to run closestFlight.c

### Step 1: Clone the repository locally

`$ git clone https://www.github.com/grivera/CSC251-80-Homework-4-Pointers.git`

### Step 2: cd into the directory and program folder you want to run

`$ cd '.\CSC251-80-Homework-4-Pointers\flight\'`

### Step 3: Compile the code using your C compiler

(Example using the gcc compiler)

`gcc *.c -o closestFlight`

### Step 4: Run the compiled .exe file

`.\closestFlight`
